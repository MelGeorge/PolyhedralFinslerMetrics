# PolyhedralFinslerMetrics

## Goal:
Given a Polyhedral Finsler Metric, write a Python script which can calculate the distance between any two points taken as input, and show a visual representation of this calculation.

## So far:
* Created functions for translating between polar/ cartesian coordinates
* Created function for ordering a given set of points based on polar coordinates
* Created function for plotting the shape of a polygon

## To do:
* Be able to take in points for the polygon from user
* Be able to take in points from user and calculate distance
* Draw a simulation to demonstrate translation/ scaling
